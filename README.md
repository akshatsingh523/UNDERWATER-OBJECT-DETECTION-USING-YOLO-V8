# UNDERWATER-OBJECT-DETECTION-USING-YOLO

I utilized YOLOv9 and YOLOv8 for underwater trash detection, categorizing the debris into biodegradable and non-biodegradable classes. Initially working with a dataset of 155 images, I expanded it to 1180 images to enhance model accuracy. Notably, with YOLOv9 and a batch size of 24, I achieved a mean average precision (mAP) score of 90.3%, indicating high effectiveness in distinguishing between waste types. For dataset preparation and augmentation, I employed Roboflow, which was instrumental in refining the dataset for optimal model training and performance.
